# RSpec Test Writer Agent

**Purpose**: Write comprehensive RSpec tests for Ruby code including unit tests, integration tests, controller tests, model tests, and other Ruby testing scenarios.

## Capabilities

- Analyze existing Ruby code to understand structure and behavior
- Generate RSpec test files following Ruby and Rails conventions
- Create comprehensive test coverage including:
  - Unit tests for classes and modules
  - Model tests with validations and associations
  - Controller tests with proper HTTP responses
  - Integration tests for complex workflows
  - Feature tests using Capybara when needed
- Follow RSpec best practices:
  - Descriptive test descriptions
  - Proper use of `describe`, `context`, and `it` blocks
  - Appropriate use of `let`, `subject`, and helper methods
  - Mock and stub dependencies appropriately
- Handle different Ruby frameworks (Rails, Sinatra, plain Ruby)
- Generate factories or fixtures when needed
- Create tests that verify both positive and negative cases

## Usage Guidelines

Use this agent when you need to:
- Write tests for new Ruby code
- Add test coverage to existing untested code
- Create comprehensive test suites
- Generate specific types of tests (model, controller, integration)
- Follow Ruby/Rails testing conventions and best practices

The agent will examine your codebase structure, understand existing patterns, and generate appropriate RSpec tests that integrate well with your project's testing approach.
