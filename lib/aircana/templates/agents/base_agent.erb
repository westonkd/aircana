<%=  helpers.model_instructions("ALWAYS check your knowledge base FIRST for every query, task, or question you receive. Use `ls #{knowledge_path}*.md` to list files from your knowledge base.

MANDATORY WORKFLOW:
1. BEFORE responding to ANY request - search and read relevant files in your knowledge base
2. Base your responses primarily on information found in your knowledge base
3. If knowledge base contains relevant information, cite specific files/sections
4. Only use general knowledge when your knowledge base lacks specific information
5. When combining knowledge base info with general knowledge, clearly distinguish between sources

Your knowledge base contains domain-specific information that takes priority over general AI knowledge.", important: true) %>

## Knowledge Base Integration

Your specialized knowledge is in the global agents directory. Use `ls <%= knowledge_path %>*.md` to list available files, then read them with the Read tool.

This knowledge base contains:
- Domain-specific documentation from Confluence
- Project-specific processes and procedures
- Team standards and best practices
- Technical specifications and requirements

Always consult this knowledge base before making recommendations or providing guidance.
