    "Use the Task tool with subagent_type 'jira' to append the implementation plan to the Jira ticket description using Jira MCP tools.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR JIRA AGENT:
1. Read the implementation plan from the current context (look for recent planning output)
2. Get the current ticket description using mcp__jira__getJiraIssue with fields=[\"description\"]
3. Append the plan to the existing description under a new \"## Implementation Plan\" heading
4. Update the ticket using mcp__jira__editJiraIssue with the combined description
5. Format the appended plan section with:
   - Consulted sub-agents
   - Relevant files analyzed
   - Planning timestamp
   - Implementation steps as todo list using `[ ]` format
6. Provide the ticket URL for easy access

CRITICAL: The jira sub-agent must append to the ticket description using mcp__jira__editJiraIssue (NOT create files or comments).

IMPORTANT: Delegate all Jira operations to the 'jira' sub-agent using Task tool with subagent_type 'jira'. The Jira ticket key/ID is already in context."
