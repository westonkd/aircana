    "Use the Task tool with subagent_type 'jira' to write the implementation plan to a Jira ticket.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR JIRA AGENT:
1. Read the implementation plan from the current context (look for recent planning output or ask user to provide plan)
2. #{$ARGUMENTS.nil? || $ARGUMENTS.empty? ? 'Ask user for Jira ticket key/ID to update' : "Update Jira ticket: $ARGUMENTS"}
3. Create or update the ticket with the plan as a markdown attachment
4. Format the plan with proper frontmatter including:
   - Consulted sub-agents
   - Relevant files analyzed
   - Planning timestamp
5. Include implementation steps as todo list using `[]` format in the body
6. Provide the ticket URL for easy access

IMPORTANT: Delegate all Jira operations to the 'jira' sub-agent using Task tool with subagent_type 'jira'."
